an alarm is waged
and the fire is the same
come up from here
come up from here
there is nothing to be changed
but the wired and the brave
come up from here
come up from here

The final place to be washed away
is to come up in, to the whirling wind
while the steps down to, where we've nothing to do
and I'll make my peace in that place.

Come up from here.
