Arose a flame,
a rose of fire
and the liars lined up to see the burn.
The world got worse under those years that kept us all inside
but we survived, et tu divide
and no longer do we rely
on the old paths that we still ride
in the hope to hear that our climbing fears
are stronger, making us still.
As is something ever will.
