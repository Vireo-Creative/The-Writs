A change is baked into the everyday of ways
       that things will never stay the same

‚Äç
And so we try to stray, but pulled back we become
I'll twiddle my thumbs a bit while I wait to see what takes place

The avenue we came down on is not the one we might leave
but different roads for different folks,
different roads make different forks,
and different forks, well, you know.

The undeniability of the difference
is that without anything not being the same
you must understand that someone will eventually need to take the blame.

And I call not-it.
