the world is different now
around we go, around we go
every spin, watching out
duck down low, duck down low.
I've climbed the highs,
drudged the downs
somehow kept my balance
while it all worked out
now I see that here and now is all we have
and I know, front to back, only that
is all it's ever been
why was there ever a thought of anything more
there is no exit here
there is no light at the end of any tunnel
there is only the time we haven't spent yet
that we can't trade in for the newer model
keep your tires on the road
your stickontheice

‍
and you're bound to be alright.

‍
I guess.
