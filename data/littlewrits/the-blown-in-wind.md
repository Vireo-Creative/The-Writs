in turpentine I find myself washing all my hands
in a world to bring the breathing in and share it with my friends.
its a sight to see the opening never will begin
when the waiting meets the coming wind, just hold on while you can.

a gale will blow as fingers cling like grains of falling sand
one by one they all let go and pile up where they land
the send-off that in advance was planned is rushed now, and gaining pace
where then, do you put the words
when the words each have no place.

one by one
they become
nothing, but an annoyance.
