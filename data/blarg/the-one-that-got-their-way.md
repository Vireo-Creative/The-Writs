There was no fight left in me when I finally came down from that hill, no swinging left to be done by these still balled-up fists. The skin was ripped and torn at the knuckles, the red of them caught the mid-days sun, and I shimmered because of it.

What is the prize when the walk alone was worth it, to the place where justice is served. It is sweet, they say, to get what one wants even before the first thrown hand. When the thrill of it all is not tarnished by either victory or defeat. When it all comes down to the way the wind blew the trees that day, and the feel of the grass poking up and into those bare feet.

Catch it while we can, they also say. Thirst for not the view of the tallest hill you will win when the other trying to stand on it is bloodied and rolling down its banks. Be instead prepared to walk back down yourself, chin either broken or held high, and the world left unlooked at.
