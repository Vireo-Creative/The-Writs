A sea of green and bark, and the sound of so many small things moving around you, are the siren song that keeps bringing you back and pulls you in deep. Creepy crawlies that within four walls would have to find their way outside at first notice of them, here are already outside, and everywhere. Somehow, you are never bothered the same way when they are normal. And they are; normal.
